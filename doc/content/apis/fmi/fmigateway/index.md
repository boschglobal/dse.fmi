## fmu_init


In this method the required yaml files are parsed and the session is configured,
if required. The gateway is set up and connected to the simbus. After a
sucessfull connection has been established, the fmu variables are indexed to
their corresponding simbus signals.

> Required by FMU.

### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.

### Returns

0 (int32_t)
: The FMU was created correctly.



## fmu_step


This method executes one step of the gateway model and signals are exchanged
with the other simulation participants.

> Required by FMU.

### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.
communication_point (double)
: The current model time of the FMU in seconds.
step_size (double)
: The step size of the FMU in seconds.

### Returns

0 (int32_t)
: The FMU step was performed correctly.




## fmu_destroy


Releases memory and system resources allocated by gateway.

> Required by FMU.

### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.

### Returns

0 (int32_t)
: The FMU data was released correctly.

### Example




## fmu_create


This method allocates the necessary gateway models. The location of the required
yaml files is set and allocated.

Fault conditions can be communicated to the caller by setting variable
`errno` to a non-zero value.

> Required by FMU.

### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.

### Returns

NULL
: The FMU was configured.

(FmuInstanceData*)
: Pointer to a new, or mutilated, version of the Fmu Descriptor object. The
  original Fmu Descriptor object will be released by the higher layer (i.e.
  don't call `free()`).

errno <> 0 (indirect)
: Indicates an error condition.

## Functions

### fmigateway_parse

This method loads the required yaml files from the resource location of the fmu.
The loaded yaml files are parsed into the fmu descriptor object.

#### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.



### fmigateway_session_configure

If session parameters were parsed from the model description, this method
configures and starts the additional models, or executes the given command.

#### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.



### fmigateway_session_end

If session parameters were parsed from the model description, this method
shuts down the additional models, or executes the given command.

#### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.



### fmigateway_session_windows_end

Termiantes all previously started windows processes.
After sending the termination signals, one additionally
step is made by the gateway to close the simulation.

#### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.
 


### fmigateway_session_windows_start

Creates windows processes based on the parameters
configured in a yaml file. Process informations are
stored for later termination.

#### Parameters

fmu (FmuInstanceData*)
: The FMU Descriptor object representing an instance of the FMU Model.
